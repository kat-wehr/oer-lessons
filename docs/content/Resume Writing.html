<p><div>Next, read this article that talks about what you can put on your resume if you’ve never held a formal job or don’t have experience in the field you want to obtain a job in. </div>

<h2>Transferable Skills</h2>
<p>As mentioned in the article, one of the keys to writing your first resume is to look at what skills you do have and how they might translate into a professional setting. As first-year students, you likely have some experience with clubs and activities from high school, and maybe even some volunteer experience. This page will help you identify skills you definitely picked up from those experiences and help you articulate how those skills apply to your career goals.</p>

<h2>Writing Accomplishment Statements</h2>
<p>Accomplishment (or achievement) statements are direct, quantifiable sentences that clearly explain to a potential employer how your previous experience qualifies you for a potential role at a new company.</p>
