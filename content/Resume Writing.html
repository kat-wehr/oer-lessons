<h2>Transferable Skills</h2>
<p>As mentioned in the article, one of the keys to writing your first resume is to look at what skills you do have and how they might translate into a professional setting. As first-year students, you likely have some experience with clubs and activities from high school, and maybe even some volunteer experience. This page will help you identify skills you definitely picked up from those experiences and help you articulate how those skills apply to your career goals.</p>
